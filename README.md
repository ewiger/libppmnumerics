Numerical extension to Parallel Particle-Mesh (PPM) Library CORE 
http://www.ppm-library.org 

To successfully compile PPM you need following pre-requisites:

* A Fortran 90/95 Compiler
* METIS 4. Here is a re-packaged version of METIS 4 that we have been using during development of PPM
* (optional, but recommended) an MPI library (e.g. OpenMPI)

Since version 1.2 PPM core and PPM numerics are released under the LGPL v.3 License.
